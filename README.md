Added a wall-mounted thermometer, since people asked for it and I liked the idea!

--- Original Description ---
Adds a simple buildable thermometer that displays the current ambient temperature and can be configured to provide temperature based alerts. You can set it to alert you when a room gets too hot or cold. If you have ever had food rot in a freezer or plants die in your greenhouse because you forgot to check the temperature, this mod is for you. Also includes a configurable temperature-sensitive power switch.

Not compatible with Parallel Power Grid.
